# Student Performance Predictor
# Project Overview
   This project demonstrates the entire lifecycle of a machine learning application, starting from data ingestion to deploying the model into production. The project focuses on predicting student performance based on various input features like gender, parental education, test preparation, and scores in other subjects. A Flask web app was developed to take input about a student and predict their potential exam score..
# Problem Statement
Educational institutions often seek ways to predict and enhance student performance. This project aims to address the following questions:

    * Can a student's performance in exams be accurately predicted based on demographic and academic features?
    * How can an automated system help institutions or educators identify students who may need additional support?

### Key Steps in the Project
**1. Data Ingestion and Transformation Pipeline**
  * Loaded the dataset, analyzed the data, and handled missing values.
  * Performed feature engineering, such as encoding categorical variables and normalizing numeric features.
  * Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

**2. Model Training Pipeline**
  * Designed and implemented a machine learning model training pipeline.
  * Experimented with various regression algorithms to predict scores, selecting the best-performing model based on metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R- 
    squared.
* Saved the trained model as a serialized file for deployment.

**3. Flask Web Application for Model Deployment**
  * Built a Flask web application to serve the model.
  * The web app allows users to input details about a student, such as gender, parental education, and test preparation status.
  * Based on the inputs, the application predicts the student's likely exam score.
  * Deployed the web application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk for production use.

**4. Production and CI/CD Pipeline**
* Developed a CI/CD pipeline for automating the build, test, and deployment processes using:
     * Docker: To containerize the application for consistent deployments.
     * AWS ECR: For storing Docker images.
     * AWS EC2: To host and run the application in a production environment.
     * GitHub Actions: To automate the CI/CD process, enabling seamless integration and deployment.
